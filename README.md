🌌 What is Jinwoo Stories?

STO-REEL is not just another reading app.
It’s a full gamified storytelling world where:

🔥 You level up,
🧠 You unlock XP, ranks, streaks,
⚔️ and creators gain power like a game character.

This platform blends Wattpad, RoyalRoad, Snapchat streaks, and Duolingo gamification — into one futuristic experience.

Designed with a cyberpunk UI, buttery smooth transitions, and a modular architecture that scales effortlessly.
